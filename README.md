- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joseph Moore
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, computer administration, Dungeons & Dragons (and other RPGs), and a wide variety of video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to utilize Kubenetes , and will after that start learning how to use Microsoft Azure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything a newbie like me can learn from.
